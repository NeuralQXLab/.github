We work on Machine Learning techniques for Quantum Physics, in particular we are developing Neural Quantum States Variational Monte Carlo approaches.
We are a [team of researchers](https://filippovicentini.com/group/) based in Paris, working between Ecole Polytechnique and College de France.

We are the main contributors behind [NetKet](https://github.com/netket/netket), but we also develop additional codes that do not make their way into NetKet directly.

You can find here some of our public works

## Public Packages

- [NQXPack](https://github.com/NeuralQXLab/nqxpack) : A simple way to save and load flax-based NN models. It provides an easy to use solution to save and load [NetKet's variational states](https://netket.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_generated/vqs/netket.vqs.MCState.html).

## Paper-associated repositories

- [PTVMC Systematic Study](https://github.com/NeuralQXLab/ptvmc-systematic-study) : State-of-the-art implementation of Infidelity optimization for NetKet, as well as infidelity-based dynamics, with autotuning of hyperparameters.
